getting this error

Looking at the error message and the code, the issue appears to be in app/page.tsx where you're importing components that haven't been properly exported. Let's fix this by checking the imports and the corresponding component files.
The error specifically mentions:
Looking at app/page.tsx, you're importing:
The issue seems to be with the Background and Desktop components. Let's check the corresponding files:
First, let's fix the Background component. The file is empty:
Here's how to properly export the Background component:
background.tsx
The Desktop component also needs to be properly exported. Since components/window.tsx is empty as well, we should implement both components:
Desktop.tsx
Make sure all the imported components in app/page.tsx are properly exported from their respective files. The error should be resolved once all components are properly exported and imported.
Let me know if you need help implementing any other components or if you have questions about the solution!

Final Codebase Context
Looking at the error message and the code, I can see that there's an issue with the Window component being imported but not properly defined. The error occurs in the Desktop component where it's trying to use the Window component.
The error message states:
Let's create the missing Window component:
Window.tsx
This implementation creates a draggable window component with minimize and close functionality. The window can be moved around by dragging its title bar, and it shows an active state when selected.
The error should be resolved once you add this component. The Window component is being used in:
Make sure the Window component is properly imported in the Desktop component:
Desktop.tsx
lets make it possible to put window in full screen

I'll modify the Window component to add fullscreen functionality. Here's the updated version:
Window.tsx
Key changes made:
Added fullscreen state and functionality:
New isFullscreen state
Added maximize/minimize button
Store previous position when going fullscreen
Return to previous position when exiting fullscreen
Added ways to toggle fullscreen:
Maximize/minimize button in the title bar
Double-click on the title bar
3. Window dimensions and positioning:
When in fullscreen, window takes up full viewport width and height (minus taskbar)
When not in fullscreen, returns to standard dimensions (800x600)
Dragging is disabled when in fullscreen mode
Visual feedback:
Different icons for maximize/minimize states
Smooth transition animation when toggling fullscreen
The window can now be:
Dragged when not in fullscreen mode
Maximized to full screen with the maximize button or by double-clicking the title bar
Minimized back to its previous size and position
Closed with the close button
Minimized to the taskbar with the minimize button

Here's a guide on how to create and switch branches in Git:
Create a new branch:
Bash
Switch between branches:
Bash
List all branches:
Bash
Delete a branch:
Bash
Push a new branch to remote:
Bash
Common workflow example:
Bash
Best Practices:
Use descriptive branch names (e.g., feature/user-auth, bugfix/login-error)
Keep branches focused on single features or fixes
Regularly sync with the main branch to avoid conflicts
Delete branches after they're merged
Remember:
-b flag creates a new branch
-c flag with switch creates a new branch
-d flag deletes a branch
-a flag shows all branches
-u flag sets up tracking with remote
comment code base and explain and document code

Final Codebase Context
I'll help document and explain the main components of this codebase. Let's break it down by key components:
Desktop Component
This is the main desktop component that manages the window system. Key features:
Manages window states (open, minimized, active)
Handles desktop icons and their click events
Dynamically loads window content based on icon clicked
Uses a state management system for window control
